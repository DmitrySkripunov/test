1. Made it with Create React App, just becasue it is the simplest way.

2. I'm not a big fan of TypeScript, so there are could be some roughness.

3. I didn't implement an abortable fetch because didnn't want to spend that extra time.

4. Use the Storeon library instead Redux, MobX etc, because the Storeon as much tiny and simple as possible.

Be happy to discuss it! :)
