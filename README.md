1. Made it with Create React App, just becasue it is the simplest way.

2. I'm not a big fan of TypeScript, so there are could be some roughness.

3. Implementation of abortable fetches is not perfect, bit working....Didn't have so much extra time.

4. Use the Storeon library instead Redux, MobX etc, because the Storeon as much tiny and simple as possible.

Be happy to discuss it! :)
